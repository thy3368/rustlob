# Create a new order

> Create an order. You can place two types of orders: limit and market. Orders can only be placed if your account has sufficient funds. Once an order is placed, your account funds will be put on hold for the duration of the order. How much and which funds are put on hold depends on the order type and parameters specified.

<Warning>
  Each profile can place a maximum of 500 open orders on a product. Once reached, the profile cannot place any new orders until the total number of open orders is below 500.
</Warning>

## API Key Permissions

This endpoint requires the "trade" permission.

| Parameter | Description                                           |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| size      | \[optional]\* Desired amount in BTC                   |
| funds     | \[optional]\* Desired amount of quote currency to use |

\* One of `size` or `funds` is required.

## Product ID

The `product_id` must match a valid product. The products list is available via the [/products](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/products/get-all-known-trading-pairs) endpoint.

## Client Order ID

The optional `client_oid` field must be a variant 1 UUIDv4 that follows the standard format. This means all lowercase and hyphens that group the characters in sequences of 8, 4, 4, 4, 12 (e.g. 1985ca2d-61ef-49f1-bfce-6c39d8462914) generated by your trading application. This field value is broadcast in the public feed for `received` messages. You can use this field to identify your orders in the public feed.

The `client_oid` is different than the server-assigned order ID. If you are consuming the public feed and see a `received` message with your `client_oid`, you should record the server-assigned `order_id` as it is used for future order status updates. The `client_oid` is NOT used after the `received` message is sent.

The server-assigned order id is also returned as the `id` field to this HTTP POST request.

If the `client_oid` is not in the correct UUIDv4 format it will be accepted via REST but NOT processed and will not be visible in future REST calls.

## Type

When placing an order, you can specify the order type. The order type you specify influences which other order parameters are required as well as how your order is executed by the matching engine. If `type` is not specified, the order defaults to a `limit` order.

**Limit** orders are both the default and basic order type. A limit order requires that you specify a `price` and one of either `size` or `funds`. The `size` parameter denotes the amount in fiat, and `funds` denotes the number of bitcoin to buy or sell. The `price` is the price per bitcoin. Limit orders are filled at the price specified or better. A sell order can be filled at the specified price per bitcoin or a higher price per bitcoin, and a buy order can be filled at the specified price or a lower price depending on market conditions. If market conditions cannot fill the limit order immediately, then the limit order becomes part of the open order book until filled by another incoming order or canceled by the user.

**Market** orders differ from limit orders in that they provide no pricing guarantees. They however do provide a way to buy or sell specific amounts of bitcoin or fiat without having to specify the price. Market orders execute immediately and no part of the market order goes on the open order book. Market orders are always considered `takers` and incur taker fees. When placing a market order you can specify `funds` and/or `size`. Funds limit how much of your quote currency account balance is used and size limits the bitcoin amount transacted.

## Stop Orders

Stop orders become active and wait to trigger based on the movement of the last trade price. There are two types of stop orders, `stop loss` and `stop entry`:

`stop: 'loss'`: Triggers when the last trade price changes to a value at or below the `stop_price`.

`stop: 'entry'`: Triggers when the last trade price changes to a value at or above the `stop_price`.

The last trade price is the last price at which an order was filled. This price can be found in the latest [match message](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#matches-channel). Not all match messages may be received due to [dropped messages](/exchange/websocket-feed/overview#sequence-numbers).

When stop orders are triggered, they execute as limit orders and are therefore subject to [holds](#holds).

## Price

The price must be specified in `quote_increment` product units. The quote increment is the smallest unit of price. For the BTC-USD product, the quote increment is `0.01` or 1 penny. Prices less than 1 penny are not accepted, and no fractional penny prices are accepted. Not required for `market` orders.

## Size

<Warning>
  **Order Size Limits Removed**

  The properties `base_max_size`, `base_min_size`, `max_market_funds` were [removed on June 30, 2022](/exchange/changes/changelog#2022-jun-30).

  The property, `min_market_funds`, has been repurposed as the notional minimum size for limit orders.
</Warning>

The size must be greater than the `base_min_size` for the product and no larger than the `base_max_size`. The size can be in incremented in units of `base_increment`. `size` indicates the amount of BTC (or base currency) to buy or sell.

`size` indicates the amount of base currency to buy or sell. The size must be no less than the `base_min_size` and no larger than the `base_max_size` for the product. However, for post-only limit orders, there is no enforced `base_max_size`. The size can be in any increment of the base currency (e.g. BTC for the BTC-USD product).

<Info>
  There is no max size restriction for `post_only` limit orders.
</Info>

## Funds

The funds field is optionally used for `market` or `limit` orders. When specified it indicates how much of the product quote currency to buy or sell. For example, a market buy for `BTC-USD` with `funds` specified as `150.00` will spend `150 USD` to buy BTC (including any fees). If the funds field is not specified for a market buy order, `size` must be specified and Coinbase Exchange uses available funds in your account to buy bitcoin.

A market sell order can also specify the `funds`. If `funds` is specified, it limits the sell to the amount of `funds` specified. You can use `funds` with sell orders to limit the amount of quote currency funds received.

A `limit` order that specifies `funds` functions similarly to a `market` order but provides more control in its ability to specify `price`. See [Limit Order With Funds](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/limit-orders) for more information on how this order works.

## Time In Force

Time in force policies provide guarantees about the lifetime of an order. There are four policies: good till canceled `GTC`, good till date `GTD`, immediate or cancel `IOC`, and fill or kill `FOK`.

`GTC` Good till canceled orders remain open on the book until canceled. This is the default behavior if no policy is specified.

`GTD` Good till date orders are valid till a specified date or time (within a 90-day hard limit) unless it has been already fulfilled or cancelled.

`IOC` Immediate or cancel orders instantly cancel the remaining size of the limit order instead of opening it on the book.

`FOK` Fill or kill orders are rejected if the entire size cannot be matched.

<Info>
  Match also refers to self trades.
</Info>

## Post Only

The post-only flag indicates that the order should only make liquidity. If any part of the order results in taking liquidity, the order will be rejected and no part of it will execute.

## Holds

For `limit` `buy` orders, we hold `price x size x (1 + fee-percent)` USD. For `sell` orders, we hold the number of Bitcoin you wish to sell. Actual fees are assessed at time of trade. If you cancel a partially filled or unfilled order, any remaining funds are released from hold.

For `market` `buy` orders where `funds` is specified, the `funds` amount is put on hold. If only `size` is specified, all of your account balance (in the quote account) is put on hold for the duration of the market order (usually a trivially short time). For a `sell` order, the `size` in BTC is put on hold. If `size` is not specified (and only `funds` is specified), your entire BTC balance is put on hold for the duration of the market order.

## Self-Trade Prevention

Self-trading is not allowed on the exchange. Two orders from the same user are not allowed to match with one another. To change the self-trade behavior, specify the `stp` flag.

| Flag | Name                          |
| :--- | :---------------------------- |
| dc   | Decrease and Cancel (default) |
| co   | Cancel oldest                 |
| cn   | Cancel newest                 |
| cb   | Cancel both                   |

See the [self-trade prevention](/exchange/concepts/matching-engine#self-trade-prevention) documentation for details about these fields.

## Order Lifecycle

The HTTP Request responds when an order is either rejected (insufficient funds, invalid parameters, etc) or received (accepted by the matching engine). A `200` response indicates that the order was received and is active. Active orders may execute immediately (depending on price and market conditions) either partially or fully. A partial execution puts the remaining size of the order in the `open` state. An order that is filled completely, goes into the `done` state.

Users listening to streaming market data are encouraged to use the `client_oid` field to identify their `received` messages in the feed. The REST response with a server `order_id` may come after the `received` message in the public data feed.

## Response

A successful order is assigned an order id. A successful order is defined as one that has been accepted by the matching engine.

<Info>
  Open orders do not expire and remain open until they are either filled or canceled.
